Hi 👋 I’m Ethan Hong, an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science.

🔬 I’m working toward a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, where I aim to develop algorithmic models of inference under uncertainty and link them to neural and circuit-level mechanisms. My long-term goal is to understand how neuronal computations give rise to behavior — from simple decisions to complex planning.

🌱 Outside the lab, I play volleyball, am learning music production 🎹, and enjoy reading about decision-making and epistemic reasoning (currently The Scout Mindset).
