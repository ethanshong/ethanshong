Hi! 👋 I’m Ethan Hong, an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science.

🔬 I’m working toward a PhD in Computational Neuroscience where I aim to develop and derive my own algorithmic models of inference under uncertainty and link them to neural/circuit/system-level mechanisms. My long-term goal in research is to understand how neuronal computations give rise to decision-making and behavior in general.

🌱 Outside the lab, I play volleyball, am learning music production, and enjoy reading about decision-making and reasoning (currently The Organized Mind by Daniel Levitin).
